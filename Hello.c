// First Code //

# include <stdio.h>

    printf("Hello World");

}

// To run in terminal:- (1) gcc (given name).c >> ./a.out {mac} ./a.exe {windows}



//                  "VARIABLE"

// variable is the name of a memory location which stores data also, name of any variable should be meaningful 
 
 /*

 Variable Rules-
 1) Variables are case sensitive
 
 i.e., int a = 30;
       int A = 40;

 2) 1st character is always alphabet or '_'

 i.e., int _age = 12; or
       int age = 12;

 3) No comma/blank space
  
  i.e., int final_price = 100;

4) No other symbol other than '_'

also for updating values of variables (for example 2 years)
i.e., int age = 22;
      age =24

 */

// Understanding code :- int->(Data Type) age->(Memory Location) = 22->(Data Stored)

// additionally:- float pi = 3.14;
//                char Hashtag = '#';



//                       "CONSTANTS"

// Constants are values that don't change
